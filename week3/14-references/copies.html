        let name = 'wes';
        let name2 = name;

        // Let's say we have an array
        const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

        // and we want to make a copy of it.
        const team = players;
        console.log(team);

        // You might think we can just do something like this:
        team[3] = 'Alicia';

        // however what happens when we update that array?
        // now here is the problem!
        /* now players[3] is the same as team[3] */
        // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
        // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

        // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

        // one way
        const team2 = players.slice();

        // or create a new array and concat the old one in
        const team3 = [].concat(players);

        // or use the new ES6 Spread
        const team4 = [...players];
        team4[3] = 'eugh';
        console.log(team4);

        const team5 = Array.from(players);

        // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

        // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

        // with Objects
        const person = {
            name: 'Wes Bos',
            age: 80
        };
        console.log(person)

        // and think we make a copy:
        const sir = person;
        sir.number = 99;

        // how do we take a copy instead?
        const sir2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99 });
        console.log(sir2);

        // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
        const cap3 = { ...person };

        // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
